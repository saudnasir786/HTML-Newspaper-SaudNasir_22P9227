## Project Description
This project recreates the front page of Daily JANG, a prominent Urdu newspaper from 1986. The recreation focuses on capturing the authentic layout of pre-1990 newspaper design, featuring a traditional three-column structure with multiple articles, headlines, and images. All content has been translated from Urdu to English and rephrased in original language while maintaining the journalistic style of the era.

## Features Implemented
- **Three-column table layout** - Main structure using HTML tables to replicate traditional newspaper columns
- **Semantic HTML5 tags** - Proper use of `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` elements
- **Multiple articles** - Three distinct news stories: Mozambique air disaster, European immigration policy, and cultural event coverage
- **Inline styling** - Extensive use of inline CSS for typography, colors, borders, and layout without external stylesheets
- **Image integration** - Four newspaper images with proper alt attributes (masthead, article photos, event images)
- **Hierarchical headings** - Proper heading structure (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`) for different article levels
- **List elements** - Unordered list for local news briefs section
- **Proper indentation** - Consistent 4-space indentation throughout the document
- **Vintage newspaper aesthetics** - Sepia background (#f4f1ea), Times New Roman font, and black borders to replicate 1980s print style
- **Sidebar content** - Special notice box and secondary articles in the right column

## Challenges Faced
The main challenge was recreating a multi-column newspaper layout using only HTML tables and inline styles without external CSS. Balancing column widths (25%-50%-25%) and ensuring proper vertical alignment across all three columns required careful attention to table attributes. Additionally, maintaining visual hierarchy with inline styles while keeping the code readable demanded strategic use of font sizes, backgrounds, and borders. These challenges were overcome by systematic testing in the browser and iterative refinement of inline style properties.
